    <h1>How to Launch BreakScheduleApp</h1>

    <p>
        To install and test BreakScheduleApp, you need to use Apple’s <strong>TestFlight</strong>.  
        Start by downloading the TestFlight app from the App Store on your iPhone or iPad.  
        Next, share your <strong>Apple ID email address</strong> with the app owner so you can be added to the group of beta testers in App Store Connect.  
        Once you’ve been added, Apple will send you an invitation email.
    </p>

    <p>
        Open the invitation email on your device and tap <em>View in TestFlight</em>.  
        Sign in with the same Apple ID you provided. Inside TestFlight, locate <strong>BreakScheduleApp</strong>, tap <em>Install</em>, and the app will download to your device.  
        TestFlight will also notify you when a new beta version is available so you can easily update.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you don’t receive the invitation email, check your spam or junk folder and confirm you are signed in with the correct Apple ID.  
        If the invitation has expired, contact the app owner to request a new one.
